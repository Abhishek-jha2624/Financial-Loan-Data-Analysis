# Financial-Loan-Data-Analysis

This project analyzes a financial loan dataset to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualize important trends, helping a lending institution monitor performance and understand its loan portfolio. Built in Python using Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy, it covers total loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, average interest rates, and average debt-to-income ratios, both overall and Month-to-Date. It also includes Good vs Bad loan segmentation (based on whether the total payment is greater than or equal to the loan amount) and visualizations such as monthly loan trends, state-wise lending activity, loan term distribution, employment length distribution, loan purpose breakdown, and home ownership impact. The notebook, dataset, and original problem statement are provided, and running the notebook only requires installing the dependencies, loading the dataset, and executing the cells to generate insights and charts that can guide data-driven decision-making.
